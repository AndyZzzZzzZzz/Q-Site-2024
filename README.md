# Q-Site-2024

This repository contains a collection of coding problems that I worked on during the Q-Site 2024 Hackathon. The challenges are derived from IBMâ€™s Quantum Computing coding challenges and primarily involve using Qiskit and Python to solve problems related to quantum algorithms and optimization.

Each solution demonstrates practical implementations of quantum computing concepts, showcasing my work with quantum gates, circuits, and optimization techniques.
